Please edit local_settings.py-example and save it as local_settings.py before
trying to run anything.

The jQuery library should be present in

<MEDIA_ROOT>/<JQUERY_FILE>

The jQuery cookie plugin should be in

<MEDIA_URL>/<JQUERY_PLUGIN_COOKIE>

(see https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie )

The a jQuery-ui library with the overcast theme and the tabs component should be
present in:

<MEDIA_URL>/<JQUERYUI_CSS_FILE>
<MEDIA_URL>/<JQUERYUI_JS_FILE>

The MEDIA_ROOT is set in local_settings.py and the jQuery variables
are set in settings.py.

Uses the flag 'silk' iconsets from famfamfam.com (Mark James) (CC3.0-AT license)
The OLE icon is derived from one of these.

uses the sorttable.js script (with some very small modifications) by Stuart Langridge (x11 license)

# only needed when serving static media with django itself
MEDIA_ROOT = path.join(PROJECT_PATH, 'site_media/')

Dependancies (earlier versions may work; these are the ones that have been
tested):

Python 2.5
Django 1.2.5
django-extensions 0.6
django-reversion 1.3.3
pytz 2011c
lxml-2.2

when deployed via mod_fcgid another python package is required:
    flup 1.0.2

if using the Oracle backend you need:

cx_Oracle 5.0.4
    which requires:
    
    Oracle instantclient-basic 11.2.0.1
    Oracle instantclient-sdk 11.2.0.1

I recommend using virtualenv and adding the following to its bin/activate
before building and installing cx_Oracle

# my additions for cx_Oracle
export ORACLE_HOME=${VIRTUAL_ENV}/lib/instantclient_11_2
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME

unzip the instantclient packages to that lib directory before building
cx_Oracle. To use a tnsnames.ora file you can then copy it to 
${ORACLE_HOME}/NETWORK/ADMIN/TNSNAMES.ORA

IMPORTANT:

Django's Oracle backend contains a bug in 

django.db.backends.oracle.base.DatabaseOperations.field_cast_sql

The call in SQL to DBMS_LOB.SUBSTR should be removed or else search Cases by name causes an error.

This bug was still present at revision 16016 of Django (after version 1.3).
