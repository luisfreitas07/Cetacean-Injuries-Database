The templates expect the Blueprint CSS library to be present in 
<SITE_MEDIA>/blueprint.

The a jQuery-ui library with the overcast theme and the tabs component should be
present in:

<SITE_MEDIA>/jquery/jquery-1.3.2.min.js
<SITE_MEDIA>/jqueryui/overcast/jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css
<SITE_MEDIA>/jqueryui/jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js

Dependancies (earlier versions may work; these are the ones that have been
tested):

Python 2.4
Django 1.2.1
django-extensions 0.5
django-reversion 1.3.1
pytz 2010k

if using the Oracle backend you need:

cx_Oracle 5.0.4
    which requires:
    
    Oracle instantclient-basic 11.2.0.1
    Oracle instantclient-sdk 11.2.0.1

I recommend using virtualenv and adding the following to its bin/activate
before building and installing cx_Oracle

# my additions for cx_Oracle
export ORACLE_HOME=${VIRTUAL_ENV}/lib/instantclient_11_2
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME

unzip the instantclient packages to that lib directory before building
cx_Oracle. To use a tnsnames.ora file you can then copy it to 
${ORACLE_HOME}/NETWORK/ADMIN/TNSNAMES.ORA
