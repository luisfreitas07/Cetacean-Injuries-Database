TODOs by type, in order of importance:

bugfixes:
- bug: Entanglement.clean() throwing an error didn't give an error message when
  editing an observation with multiple cases, one of which was the entanglement
- allow merging of Entanglement cases with gear-owner info
- removed nested TBODY in merge form for entanglements
- taxon merge doesn't work when Taxon.tsn is defined as unique
- IE doesn't show table-sort arrows
- fix jqueryui font sizes (too big in widgets in IE)
    vessel type in particular
- 'observer on land' fake field for vessels marked as 'land'
- secured the 'clear cache' link
- using google static maps API probably violates their terms-of-use. is there a
    noaa charts equivalent?

important improvements:
- add 'n/a' value to GearAnalysis.gear_compliant (and maybe have it default to
  that when gear_regulated is False)
- flexible search interface
- tag interface with color-coding of tags
- 'needs review' by a particular user field
- update poster!
- add permissions for SI&M editors
- add interface for deleting ObservationExtensions that are no longer relevant
  because the cases an Observation is relevant to have changed
- use pre_delete signal to set refernces to a model to None
- use 'unknown' option throughout site
- contact types (seem to be making generic contacts)
- contact info for documentation
- stranding fields:
    Animal.necropsied_by (Contact)
    Animal.necropsy_findings?
    Case.valid
        more values between suspected and confirmed
    Observation.confidence
- add timezone to date-times
- deletion!
    with warnings

minor improvements:
- add gear_present property to cases (entanglements?) that is yes if any of
    their relevant observations are yes
- make delete tag link bigger
- deleting a document should send you back to it's attach_to page
- if a tab has an error on observation editing, it should be redirected to
- importing an invalid taxon just gives an error message. should import valid
  taxon with feedback.
- Vessel.contact should have option for 'same as observer/reporter'
- replace named media-url with DJANGO.CORE.CONTEXT_PROCESSORS.MEDIA
- use JS to update things like IDs and OLE warnings while editing a case
- list of recent stuff (on homepage)
- make clear what the vessel-info fields are that are hidden
- API change in DAGEdge: change subtype/supertype to generic DAG names
- add icons for gear body-location
- add icons for observations with location data
- add map to case pages
- add map to animal pages

minor tweaks:
- add message to tables that are sortable explaining such
- change 'probable' to 'observed' in 'probable taxon/gender'
- if an observed taxon differs from determined taxon, should be noted
- define Observation.tagged
- add Django settings for Documents
- tooltips for ID-box (defining ids)
- shipstrike is two words
- striking vessel flag should default to unknown
- 'taxons' should be taxa
- fontographically set-off NMFS ID numbers

handy stuff:
- add duplicate-observation facility
    "duplicate this observation <x> times" creates a form to create <x> new
    observations whose fields are the same as the original obs, except for a few
    chosen fields. one row for each new obs, one column for each modified field
- affiliation merging
- use graphviz to show relationships between Animals, Cases, and Observations
- poster of workflow.
- 'case type' for ones that don't have fields specifc to them
- automate the generation of the tabbed pages
- add icons for actions
- google-charts venn-diagram for gear-types
- gitweb hosting at NOAA
