General order to do thing in (and a timeframe):

jan. - Define an initial database model necessary for tracking entanglements. (done)
jan. - Define an initial database model necessary for tracking shipstrikes.
jan. - Implement the entanglement model and a usable interface.
feb. - Refine the entanglement models and interface upon feedback.
feb. - Implement the shipstrike model (and interface).
feb. - Refine the shipstrike models and interface upon feedback.
by mar. 1st - Database "goes live": begins actually storing entanglement data on a
     properly backed-up server.
mar? - import data from old MS-Access entanglement databases
mar? - begin storing shipstrike data
apr? - implement importation of data from national databases
may? - new interface features, particularly mapping of locations.
jun/jul? - extension to strandings?

TODO in order of importance:

Contact-editing should work!
gear analysis model/pages
    gear-owner model/pages
shipstrike pages
make observation editing page more intuitive
deletion!
    with warnings
case merging!
contacts/animals management.
    prompt for deletion when they are no longer referred to by cases/observations
use ITIS numbers in Taxon management
    import from ITIS
add icons for actions
date-picker widget for non-uncertain dates
selected taxon should be clear
    in IE!
    make search box disappear
search for "G. species" in taxon widget
test "70 10.1N" in lat/lng input
back to tabbed forms!
    links at bottom of each tab to proceed to the next one
    narrative on the side?
    submit button is in last tab
observer platform field in Observations
    aerial
    naval
        whale-watch
        commerical marine (incl. fisherman)
        recreational
        research
        gov. (incl. DoD, USGS)
    land
    other
    unknown
make clear what the vessel-info fields are that are hidden
administrative page for cleaning up animals with no cases.
administrative page for cleaning up cases with no observations.
administrative page for duplicate contacts
case-list sorts by case (most recent first)
search/query! (on homepage)
list of recent stuff (on homepage)
make subclass the DateTimeField instead of using the DateTime app
