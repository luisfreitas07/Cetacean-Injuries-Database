General order to do thing in (and a timeframe):

jan. - Define an initial database model necessary for tracking entanglements. (done)
jan. - Define an initial database model necessary for tracking shipstrikes.
jan. - Implement the entanglement model and a usable interface.
feb. - Refine the entanglement models and interface upon feedback.
feb. - Implement the shipstrike model (and interface).
feb. - Refine the shipstrike models and interface upon feedback.
by mar. 1st - Database "goes live": begins actually storing entanglement data on a
     properly backed-up server.
mar? - import data from old MS-Access entanglement databases
mar? - begin storing shipstrike data
apr? - implement importation of data from national databases
may? - new interface features, particularly mapping of locations.
jun/jul? - extension to strandings?

TODO in order of importance:

Contact-editing should work!
gear analysis model/pages
use ITIS numbers in Taxon management
    import from ITIS
shipstrike pages
make observation editing page more intuitive
deletion!
    with warnings
case merging!
add icons for actions
contacts/animals management.
    prompt for deletion when they are no longer referred to by cases/observations
