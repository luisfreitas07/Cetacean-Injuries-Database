      This is a guide for using the database to generate reports. The basic steps are:
      <procedure>
        <step>Choose a format to write the template in. The report will be in this format.</step>
        <step>Choose the cases whose info you want in the report.</step>
        <step>Do a case-search that includes those cases.</step>
        <step>On the search results page, there will be a button to generate a report for those cases. This includes all the cases that matched the search, even if only the first few are list on the page.
        </step>
        <step>On the report-generating page, the matching cases will be listed. Check off the ones you want to include in the report. (Under the list of cases is a 'check all' button.)</step>
        <step>If you're reading this, you're probably uploading a new template, so choose 'new'.</step>
        <step>Pick a file to upload, and indicate what the format of the reported generated with it will be. If you give it a name, it will be saved in the database for future use (and can be selected by choosing 'existing' above.) If you leave the name blank, it will be used to generate a report, but not saved. This is useful for testing.</step>
        <step>Press 'generate report' and the template will be uploaded, filled in with data from the selected cases, and the resulting report will be sent back to your browser. If it's in a format you're browser can display, it will. Otherwise it will be downloaded and saved.</step>
